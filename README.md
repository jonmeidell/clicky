## The name of the game:

_Choose a card, any card, but be careful not to choose the same card twice!_  This memory game is to see if you can choose each card only once.  See how far you can get without picking the same card twice.

### Backend

After picking a card, they will get shuffled around.  The app keeps track of which cards and the number of cards you choose before you click on a repeat image.

How was this made?
